Abstract: Abstract: Abstract:
The main aim of the protocol is to store and retrieve mappings between MAC address and route 

To Run the implementation:

1. Run aliases.sh by first assigning it executable permissions using 'sudo chmod 777 aliases.sh'

2. Become root user by using 'sudo su'

3. Run aliases.sh by using './aliases.sh'

4. Use 'python filename.py' to run the following python files in the given order on separate  	terminals:
	a. switch1server.py
	b. switch2server.py
	c. switch3server.py
	d. switch1client.py
	e. switch2client.py
	f. switch3client.py

5. The results will be displayed on terminals after 1 minute
