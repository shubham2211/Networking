3. Installation of BiRD on Linux:

	root@debian:~#  apt-get install bird

4.Linux by default doesnt forwards network traffic, so we must turn forwarding on for IPv4 on our server this can be done with the following command on the shell:

	root@debian-quagga:~# sysctl net.ipv4.ip_forward=1
	net.ipv4.ip_forward = 1

5. Use the following configuration files and copy them to default bird.conf on separate laptops:
	q5isp1.txt
	q5isp2.txt
	q5isp3.txt
	q5isp4.txt
	q5rs.txt

6. To start the bird process type following commands:
	root@debian-bird:~# bird
	root@debian-bird:~# birdc

7.If you want to check our neighbour BiRD gives as a bunch of information
